uuart (universial uart)

uuart is a set of C source files that implement a common set of functions that can be used in a portale way between Windows and OSX. The uarts on Windows and OSX are not that similar at least in the set of functions used to access them.  However, they basically act the same way once everything is set up and you are just reading and writing bytes.  So with a little effort developed this code to allow me to port code written on either platform.  Hopefully other folks find it also useful, enjoy!
