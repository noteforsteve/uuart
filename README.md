uuart (universial uart)

uuart is a project that implements a set of function to access the uart on Windows or OSX in a portable way. The uarts on Windows and OSX are not that similar at least in the set of functions used to access them.  However, they basically behave very similarly once everything is set up and you are just reading and writing bytes.  So with a little effort I developed this code to allow me to port code written on either platform.  Hopefully other folks find it also useful, enjoy.
